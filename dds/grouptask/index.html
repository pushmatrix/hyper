      <h1>Toolbox Brief: The App Challenge</h1>
      <p>
        You have <strong>3.5 weeks</strong> to create a web-based app based on Open Data that will benefit the city of Stockholm. 
      </p>

      <p>On October 30th, you will be showcasing your app in an open exhibition. The public will be invited, the press will be present, and members of the city will attend. Your job is to amaze them.</p>

      <p>You will be in groups of 3. The groups will be posted <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApxNqfd1CVrBdGltbGdqOEpKOThzZTRxbFdxTEZ2eUE#gid=0" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

      <b>The required features are:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Interactivity (can't just be a visualization).</li>

          <li>Must be Open Source</li>
          <li>Each group member must write code. No one can be a "designer" only.</li>
          <li>Be hosted online</li>
        </ul>

      <b>Extras:</b>
        <ul>

          <li>Responsive.</li>
          <li>Have its own domain name.</li>

      <b>Due: Wednesday, October 30th</b>
      </p>

      <h2>Where to Start</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Explore as many different data sets as possible. There's a list of stuff <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApxNqfd1CVrBdGppQWFKWnpsa210WDcxb0swYWN5V2c&usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></li>
        <li>Brainstorm ideas for what you'd like to build.</li>
        <li>Google for inspiration. <a href="http://parkfinder.ottawadogblog.ca/" target="_blank">This is my favourite example.</a></li>
        <li>Don't limit yourself to what you know/are comfortable with. Come ask me if your features are possible.</li>
        <li>Work on functionality first. Design later.</li>
      </ul>
