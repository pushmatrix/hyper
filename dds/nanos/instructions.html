      <h1>HTML & CSS Individual Task</h1>
      <p>
        Put on your thinking cap! Your task is to come up with a product or service around DATA, and then build a website for it. Be as creative with the idea as you can, and don't limit yourself to what is possible today (ex: mind reading goggles, or tracking the location of all cats in the world). What does tomorrow's hottest data site look like?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          I created an example website over here: <a href="index.html" target="_blank">NanOS&trade;</a>
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p><em>The site does not need to be interactive (buttons & forms don't need to do anything). </em></p>

      <hr>
      The required features are:
        <ul>
          <li>At least 3 different inputs (ex: buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, forms)</li>
          <li>At least one embedded part (ex: google map, video, twitter, etc...) </li>
          <li>Have some links</li>
          <li>Be hosted online (you should be able to send me a link to it)</li>
        </ul>

      Extras:
        <ul>
          <li>Set a favicon (the little icon in the browser's tab)</li>
          <li>Have different pages (with links to each other)</li>
          <li>Be responsive</li>
          <li>Add <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_animations.asp">CSS3 animations</a></li>
        </ul>

      <b>Deliverable: Add the link to your website to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApxNqfd1CVrBdEdkZF9BTnZlb3E1d2hIc1dkcDQ3MFE&usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Doc</a></b>
